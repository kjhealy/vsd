Course materials and website for [Visualizing Social Data](https://visualizingsociety.com), which [I](https://kieranhealy.org/about) am teaching at Duke University in the Spring of 2024. 

### Acknowledgements

Many thanks to the frighteningly energetic and exceedingly helpful [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com) for, as usual, being ahead of the adoption curve with these tools and making several of his own courses [publicly available](https://www.andrewheiss.com/teaching/). Much of the back-end code and the `targets` pipeline used here has been lightly-adapted from Andrew's work. 

### Tools

Previously I built this and similar sites using a combination of RMarkdown, [hugo](https://gohugo.io), a [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), and various pieces of string. This time everything is done with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) for the documents,  [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) to manage the build pipeline (instead of `make`), [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to control the build environment (instead of, uh, `nothing`). The slides are made with assistance from my own convenience [`kjhslides`](https://kjhealy.github.io/kjhslides) package, which I do not recommend you use because it's janky and poorly documented.

The idea is that you can build the whole thing—site, slides, and all—in a controlled way with a recent version of [R](https://r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://posit.co). 

0. The repository for the whole project is [on GitHub](https://github.com/kjhealy/vsd).
1. Open `vsd.Rproj` to launch the project in RStudio. ([Learn more about RStudio projects.](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html))
2. RStudio should ask whether you want to install the [`renv` package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/), or you can install it yourself by running `install.packages("renv")` in the R console.
3. Run `renv::restore()` in the R console to install all the required packages for the project.
4. Run `targets::tar_make()` in the R console to build everything.

In practice there will probably be some hiccups, but in my experience `renv` really has greatly narrowed the yawning abyss of [dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) that one much traverse to reproduce a complex project.
