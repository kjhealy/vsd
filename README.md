## SOCIOL 232 / Visualizing Social Data / Spring 2023

## Kieran Healy, Duke University

This repo contains Course materials and website for [Visualizing Social
Data](https://visualizingsociety.com), which
[I](https://kieranhealy.org/about) am teaching at Duke University in the
Spring of 2023.

### Acknowledgements

Many thanks to the frighteningly energetic and exceedingly helpful
[Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com) for, as usual, being ahead
of the adoption curve with these tools and making several of his own
courses [publicly available](https://www.andrewheiss.com/teaching/).
Much of the back-end code and the `targets` pipeline used here has been
lightly-adapted from Andrewâ€™s work.

### Dependency graph

Everything is a
[DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) now. The
overall structure of the site is a bit messy in part because it does a
bunch of work to produce the slides, convert them to PDF with
`decktape`, zips up assignments and projects, and other things.
