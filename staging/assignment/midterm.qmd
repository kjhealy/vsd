```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = "center")
source(here::here("R", "slide-things.R"))
```

## The Midterm project's zip file.

```{r project-download, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
project_buttons("/projects/midterm")
```

1. Launch the midterm project by double-clicking on the `midterm.Rproj` file. It will launch a new instance of R. Remember you can have more than one project open and running at a time. Each one is a self-contained RStudio instance. They don't know anything about each other.

2. Once RStudio is running, take a look at the `analysis.Rmd` file. Do the tasks it asks.

3. Save your work.

4. Make sure the `analysis.Rmd` document will knit as an HTML file. 

5. Zip up the whole problem set folder (in the Finder, select the folder, right click, and choose "Compress") and submit it to the Sakai Dropbox.
