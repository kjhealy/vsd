## Gapminder GDP data
gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder.csv")

## Palmer penguins data
penguins <- read_csv("data/penguins.csv")
```

# Task: Experiment with some geoms.

## 1. The `gapminder` data

Insert a code chunk below. You can insert it one using the menus: Code > Insert Chunk. But the keyboard shortcut is much more convenient: `Command-Option-I`. That means press the `Command`, `Option` and letter `i` keys all at once.   
Inside the chunk, create a scatterplot with the gapminder data. (Hint: like last week, use `geom_point()`.) Put (`gdpPercap`) on the x-axis, and (`lifeExp`) on the y-axis. Represent population by size. Represent continent by color. 

> DELETE THIS LINE AND INSERT THE CHUNK

Next, create a new chunk below. This time, instead of representing continent by color, read the help page for `facet_wrap()` and make a plot  _faceted_ by continent (i.e. with a different panel for each continent)

> DELETE THIS LINE AND PUT THE FIRST CHUNK HERE

### 2. The `penguins` data

```{r}
penguins
```


Draw some histograms (`geom_histogram()`) and scatterplots (`geom_point()`) to investigate the data. Which columns in the table does it make sense to represent by color, or to facet by? Choose one of these variables and, in one or more chunks below, draw some plots with them. Say what it tells you about the `penguins` data.
