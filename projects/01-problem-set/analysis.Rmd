## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r addition}
1 + 1
```

## The Tidyverse Packages

In this next chunk we will load the Tidyverse suite of packages.

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## The Gapminder data

Here we load a data file from the `data/` folder inside this project.

```{r load-gapminder-data}
gapminder <- read_csv(here::here("data", "gapminder.csv"))
```

Now we can look at it:

```{r}
gapminder
```

## A very first plot

We embed plots in our document. For example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
gapminder |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```
