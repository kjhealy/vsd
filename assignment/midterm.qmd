```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = "center")
source(here::here("R", "slide-things.R"))
```

```{r project-download, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}

```

1. Launch the project by double-clicking on the `midterm.Rproj` file. It will launch a new instance of R. Remember you can have more than one project open and running at a time. Each one is a self-contained RStudio instance. They don't know anything about each other.

2. Once RStudio is running, take a look at the `analysis.qmd` file. Answer the questions.

3. Save your work.

4. Render the `analysis.qmd` document as an HTML file. 

5. Zip up `midterm` folder. 

- 5a. On Mac OS, in the Finder, select the folder, right click (that is, hold down the Control key and click), and choose "Compress"

```{r project-structure, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "compress-mac-1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

- 5b. On Windows, Locate the file or folder that you want to zip. Press and hold (or right-click) the file or folder, select (or point to) Send to, and then select Compressed (zipped) folder. A new zipped folder with the same name is created in the same location. 

6. Upload the zipped file to Canvas.
