```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = "center")
source(here::here("R", "slide-things.R"))
```

## Task 1: Download and launch this week's project.

```{r project-download, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
project_buttons("/projects/02-problem-set")
```

1. Launch the project by double-clicking on the `02-problem-set.Rproj` file. It will launch a new instance of R. Remember you can have more than one project open and running at a time. Each one is a self-contained RStudio instance. They don't know anything about each other.

2. Once RStudio is running, take a look at the `analysis.Rmd` file. Do the tasks it asks.

3. Save your work.

4. Knit the `analysis.Rmd` document as an HTML file. Try knitting it as a Word file, too.

5. Zip up the problem set folder (in the Finder, select the folder, right click, and choose "Compress") and submit it to the Sakai Dropbox.

```{r project-structure, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "compress-action.png"), error = FALSE)
```
